## Exam-Taking Strategies

### Understanding Question Types

The AWS Certified Data Engineer - Associate exam includes multiple-choice and multiple-response questions:

1. **Multiple-choice**: Select one correct answer from 4-5 options
2. **Multiple-response**: Select 2 or more correct answers from 5-6 options

### Approaching Different Question Types

#### Scenario-Based Questions

1. Identify the key requirements in the scenario
2. Determine what problem needs to be solved
3. Consider constraints (cost, performance, security)
4. Eliminate options that don't meet requirements
5. Select the most appropriate solution

#### Service Selection Questions

1. Understand the strengths and limitations of each service
2. Consider integration points with other services
3. Evaluate based on requirements (scalability, cost, etc.)
4. Look for specific features mentioned in the question

#### Configuration Questions

1. Understand the default settings of services
2. Know common configuration options
3. Consider best practices for the given scenario
4. Eliminate clearly incorrect options

### Time Management

- The exam has 65 questions in 130 minutes (2 hours and 10 minutes)
- This gives you approximately 2 minutes per question
- Spend less time on straightforward questions
- Flag difficult questions and return to them later
- Leave 10-15 minutes at the end for review

### Elimination Strategies

When unsure about an answer:
1. Eliminate obviously incorrect options
2. Look for absolute terms (always, never) which are often incorrect
3. Identify options that partially address the scenario but miss key requirements
4. Compare similar options to find subtle differences
5. When down to two options, choose the one that best aligns with AWS best practices
