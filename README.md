This certification complements machine learning work in several ways:
- It covers how to build reliable data pipelines that feed ML models
- It teaches how to store and organize data for efficient ML processing
- It addresses data quality and governance, which are critical for ML
- It provides knowledge of real-time data processing for ML inference
- It serves as an excellent foundation before pursuing ML-specific certifications

### What prerequisites should I have before pursuing this certification?
Recommended prerequisites include:
- Basic understanding of AWS services (compute, storage, networking)
- Familiarity with database concepts and SQL
- Understanding of data formats (CSV, JSON, Parquet)
- Basic programming knowledge (Python is particularly helpful)
- Some experience with data processing concepts
